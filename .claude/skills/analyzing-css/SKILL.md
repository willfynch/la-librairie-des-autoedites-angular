When analyzing css, always include:

1. **Repeat the question**: Tell me what I asked you so I know you understood well
2. **Read the necessary files**: Generally I tell you which files to read but you have to be autonomous and look for other files that can be related to the file you are reading (for example @use rules in SCSS)
3. **Give me the answer**: Give me the answer to my questions with few words, only what's necessary
4. **To go further**: Give me insights, and critics regarding my code, propose improvements regarding browser support, accessibility, maintainability, good practices and so on. No more than 3 things in this part, and be concise. The goal is to give me additional infos to level up, not to overwhelm me.

Keep explanations conversational.
